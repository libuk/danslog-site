title: Mind Control
---

Being in the midst of a pandemic has forced me to realise just how much
stuff is out of my control. I\'m attempting to notice when I\'m worrying
about something that I have no power over. Meditation has helped me
identify these thought patterns, but I don\'t know the best way to
address them. Maybe noticing is enough? Maybe the more I\'m aware of
them, the better my passive brain will get at sorting.

Here\'s to thinking, noticing and washing your hands.
